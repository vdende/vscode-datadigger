# ABL DataDigger Launcher for VS Code

A simple VS Code extension to launch DataDigger for OpenEdge ABL projects.

## Related Software
- [DataDigger](https://datadigger.wordpress.com/) is an OpenEdge ABL application for querying Progress databases, written by [Patrick Tingen](https://github.com/patrickTingen). A DataDigger instance is bundled with this extension, but it can also be installed [manually](https://github.com/patrickTingen/DataDigger).
- This extension depends on the [OpenEdge ABL](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RiversideSoftware.openedge-abl-lsp) extension by [Riverside Software](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/RiversideSoftware).

## Description
For every OpenEdge project with a configured database connection, DataDigger can be launched directly from the VS Code Command Palette.

You can either use a custom-installed and configured DataDigger instance, or use the bundled DataDigger out of the box.

## Usage
At startup, the extension detects the available OpenEdge projects.
Via the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`), DataDigger can be launched using the command:

`ABL DataDigger: Launch`

If multiple OpenEdge projects are detected, you will be prompted to select the project to use.
